Use 5 condition variables to satisfy the 3 requirements of critical section problems: Mutual Exclusion, Progress and Bounded Waiting.
3 condition variables are used for WriteTerminal(writer, writing and echobusy).
They are used to ensure that only one is writing at a time and does not start writing while terminal is still echoing.  WriteTerminal is blocked until all writing is finished.
2 condition variables are used in ReadTerminal (readable & reader) to insure that only one is reading at a time and only read until the buffer is ready to be read.
ReceiveInterrupt will initiate WriteDataRegister, if and only if nothing is currently writing to the screen.
TransmitInterrupt will keep writing to the screen as long as there is something to be written.
Once the loop is started, only TransmitInterrupt will call WriteDataRegister.
